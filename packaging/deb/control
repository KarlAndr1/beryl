Description: The Beryl scripting language
  A small embeddable, dynamically typed and scoped, scripting language.
  The language's main feature is its ability to be shaved down to run without access to libc or any form
  of dynamic memory management. 
  This package includes both the standalone interpreter and the library and C header, with the beryl standard library included.
